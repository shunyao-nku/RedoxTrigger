# A Walkthrough of Taxonomic and Co-occurrence Analyses
These are R scripts used to perform taxonomic and co-occurrence analyses following the paper, N/S Elements Transformation Modulating Lithospheric Microbial Communities by Single-species Manipulation

# Taxonomic abundance and PCoA analyses 
Top abundance taxa can be selected and drawin using our Stack Plot of Taxa Abundance.R, and PCoA referred to PCoA Anlysis.R

# Estabilishment of Co-occurrence Network and Topological Properties
Co-occurrence Network includes the calculation of correlations of taxa versus taxa and taxa versus environmental factors and the calculation of topological properties of networks and their corresponding random networks. 

# Correlation analysis
Refer to Correlation calculation.R

# Venn Network Graph
A pretreatment of data used for generate Venn graph in Cytoscape.
