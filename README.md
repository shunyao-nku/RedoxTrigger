# A Walkthrough of Taxonomic and Co-occurrence Analyses
These are R scripts used to perform taxonomic and co-occurrence analyses following the paper, N/S Elements Transformation Modulating Lithospheric Microbial Communities by Single-species Manipulation

# Taxonomic abundance and PCoA analyses 
Top abundance taxa can be selected and drawin using our Stack Plot of Taxa Abundance.R, and PCoA refers to PCoA Anlysis.R

# Estabilishment of Co-occurrence Network and Topological Properties
Co-occurrence Network includes the calculation of correlations of taxa versus taxa and taxa versus environmental factors and the calculation of topological properties of networks and their corresponding random networks. Refer to Co-occurrence Network.R

# Correlation analysis
Refer to Correlation calculation.R

# Venn Network Graph
A pretreatment of data shown in Venn Network Graph-Pretreatment.R used for generating Venn graph in Cytoscape.
